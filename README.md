This is a Python CLI program dedicated for discovering subdomains and folders of the targeted domain.

In addition, the program can be used for discovering every possible webpage of the domain.

⚠️ Attention ⚠️

Be careful what domain you are using, as explicit permission must taken first before any actions.
